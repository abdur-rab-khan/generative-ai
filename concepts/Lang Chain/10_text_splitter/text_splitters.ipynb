      "The Command Line\n",
      "There are a lot of different ways to use Git. There are the original command-line tools, and there\n",
      "are many graphical user interfaces of varying capabilities. For this book, we will be using Git on the\n",

      "of the GUIs implement only a partial subset of Git functionality for simplicity. If you know how to\n",
      "run the command-line version, you can probably also figure out how to run the GUI version, while\n",
      "the opposite is not necessarily true. Also, while your choice of graphical client is a matter of\n",
      "personal taste, all users will have the command-line tools installed and available.\n",
      "So we will expect you to know how to open Terminal in macOS or Command Prompt or PowerShell\n",
      "in Windows. If you don’t know what we’re talking about here, you may need to stop and research\n",
      "that quickly so that you can follow the rest of the examples and descriptions in this book.\n",
      "Installing Git\n",
      "Before you start using Git, you have to make it available on your computer. Even if it’s already\n",
      "installed, it’s probably a good idea to update to the latest version. You can either install it as a\n",

      "\n",
      "This book was written using Git version 2. Since Git is quite excellent at preserving\n",
      "backwards compatibility, any recent version should work just fine. Though most of\n",
      "the commands we use should work even in ancient versions of Git, some of them\n",
      "might not or might act slightly differently.\n",
      "Installing on Linux\n",
      "If you want to install the basic Git tools on Linux via a binary installer, you can generally do so\n",
      "through the package management tool that comes with your distribution. If you’re on Fedora (or\n",
      "any closely-related RPM-based distribution, such as RHEL or CentOS), you can use dnf:\n",

      "19Installing from Source\n",
      "Some people may instead find it useful to install Git from source, because you’ll get the most recent\n",
      "version. The binary installers tend to be a bit behind, though as Git has matured in recent years,\n",
      "this has made less of a difference.\n",
      "If you do want to install Git from source, you need to have the following libraries that Git depends\n",
      "on: autotools, curl, zlib, openssl, expat, and libiconv. For example, if you’re on a system that has dnf\n",
      "(such as Fedora) or apt-get (such as a Debian-based system), you can use one of these commands to\n",
